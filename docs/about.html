<p>Macrodial</p>
<p>This application was mostly developped to address my own needs. I live in hong kong, work for a large corporation and travel to japan often. My initial goal was to use IDD numbers, use my corporate access numbers and process the unusual japanese handling of numbers without having many duplicate entries in my contacts. No other app I could find provided the workflow I wanted or the flexibility in processing numbers I needed.</p>
<p>My goal thus was to provide a comprehensive set of tools to process phone numbers and a simple screen to use the macros and dial. I added ability to share the rules over the internet and a few extensions to try to make useful to others.</p>
