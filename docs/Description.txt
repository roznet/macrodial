DESCRIPTION
MacroDial is a tool to help edit and automatically change numbers from your address book according to some rules based on the way you want to call: IDD, calling card, corporate access number, without entering multiple entry in the phonebook.

TARGET USERS
This program is intended to be useful for 
- people who travel and need to dial the same number in diverse way, for example you dial +813 5555 5555 to call japan when you are in Hong kong, but 03 5555 5555 when you are in japan.
- People who have access to IDD prefix code, or use carrier like softbank in japan that do not process the + as expected.
- People who have corporate access number that require processing of the number to extract the right extension.
- People using multiple calling card from different countries.

GOAL OF THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM
- provide a full set of rules to make any generation of numbers possible.
- be able to share the rules via the internet. They can be downloaded without compromising personal codes or PINs.
- have a simple way to enter rules as well as a more advanced complete mode.
- provide the user workflow that fitted my need.

HOW TO USE IT
- when you start the program a wizard will let you choose a few options or package of rules. Currently only for Japan Softbank or Hong Kong three, but you can download more from the web. If you have a code (from friends or from me) you can access rules specific to a company for example.
- After you select a contact, you can choose the number and if you click on a rule (or macro) that rule will be applied to the number. 
- No number will ever be called without you pressing the call button, so you can review to make sure the number is correct.
- To create a new rule you can simply edit the number in the Dial screen, and if a simple way to regenerate the number is detected the program will offer to save it as a new rules.
- If you are a more advanced user you can design your rules from the edit macro function in the setting screen.
